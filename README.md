#NOTE: 
I am not gunna update this server to 27.5 because the build (1439425927) is still bugged as hell.

IP and Client is localhost, no need for changes unless you are making it public, simply import the .sql, edit the config (w/server.cfg) files to match your database user and pass, and youre good to go.
